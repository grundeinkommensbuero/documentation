## Code

Both websites use the same codebase, but take data from different directus instances (See 'Directus').

## History

The main XBGE website was the first site that was built for the organisation. It used to be written in Gatsby, with Wordpress integration for the blog and with Contentful as a CMS. The contentful space still exists and can be found here: [Contentful Space](https://app.contentful.com/spaces/af08tobnb0cl/entries). The old gatsby repo also still exists: [Gatsby](https://github.com/grundeinkommensbuero/website-gatsby)
In 2022, we made the switch to Next.js and changed the CMS to Directus. We also launched the Berlin campaign website. The new website repo can be found here: [Next.js repo](https://github.com/grundeinkommensbuero/website-next)

## Components

The website has a number of interactive components that were created at varying times for several different campaigns. Not all of them are currently in use.

# Hero

A simple hero section with a large background image and a slight zoom. Currently in use on both the XBGE and Berlin websites. Can be edited via Directus.

# News section

Basically a section of three images with corresponding texts. Currently in use only on the XBGE website, directly below the hero, but has been used on the Berlin site in the past. Can be edited via Directus.

# News banner

A banner that appears on top of the whole screen. Could be used for announcements, but hasn't been used in a while. There is currently no Directus integration.
